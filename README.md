# Longest Common Subsequence

Given two strings, find the (length of the) longest subsequence common to two strings - using DP. 

**Case 1:** Without space optimization (Space: O(mn)), returning only length of the LCS.

**Case 2:** With space optimization (Space: O(n)), returning only length of the LCS.

**Case 3:** Return the longest common subsequence
